## ðŸ“Š Insights

- We noticed that Kylian MbappÃ© is ahead of Erling Haaland in market value.
- When comparing goals and assists, we observed two opposite dynamics: MbappÃ© had more assists, while Haaland scored more goals. This same trend repeated for the average goals per match, and average assists per match.
- In the top 10 players with the highest market value, we have Kylian MbappÃ©, Erling Haaland, Harry Kane, Mohamed Salah, and Lukaku leading the list. Among these  players, 8 are forwards, while 2 are midfielders. Additionally, we have 4 Centre-Forwards, 3 Left-Wingers, 1 Right-Winger, 1 Attacking Midfield, and 1 Center-Midfielder.
- Analyzing by club, we have two players from Manchester City and two from Paris Saint-Germain among the top 10 most valued players. The other clubs have one player each. The clubs are as follows: Borussia Dortmund, Tottenham Hotspur, Liverpool FC, Chelsea FC, Manchester United, and FC Barcelona.
- England has the highest number of players in the dataset, followed by France, Spain, Brazil, and Germany. These five countries have the highest total market values due to having more players on the list.
- France and Norway have the highest maximum value, as they have the two most valued players. Egypt has the same maximum and minimum value, along with the highest average value, because the country has only one player in the list (Salah). Other countries have higher averages because they have few players in the database, such as South Korea, Norway, Slovakia, and Slovenia.
- Manchester City leads in the total market value sum, followed by Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester United, Chelsea FC, and Bayern Munich.
- When we observe the average market value per club, we notice that Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain, Inter Milan, and Liverpool have the highest values, indicating how valuable the players of these teams are.
